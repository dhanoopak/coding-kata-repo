# TDD Kata

`TDD Kata` is a simple coding exercise developed in C# by following Test Driven Development. The Coding Kata approach is followed for the development.

This simple exercise is designed to help programmers improve their TDD skills. The idea behind the Kata is to learn by repeating an exercise over and over again. The Katas help the programmers to learn TDD approaches quickly.

TDD has three phases.
    Red — think about what you want to develop
    Green — think about how to make your tests pass
    Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation

    1. Write a failing test
    2. Write the minimum code to make your test pass
    3. Refactor
